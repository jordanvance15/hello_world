First Repository For Learning Git

Hello Everyone!

I am following this tutorial as my first step in the wide world of Git, I'm an engineer in the medical device industry, and am currently customer facing, I'm hoping to get into development now that i've spent a few years paying off student loans; so I'm going to start improving my chances by learning more programming!  I'm interested mainly in embedded system development and hardware/firmware but i'm going to start my journey as many others do with C and Python.  I'm also finally upgrading to an android phone so I may create an app or two once I start getting into it.

Thanks!
